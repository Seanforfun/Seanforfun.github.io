## Algorithm | 01 knapsack question DP
01 knapsack question is a very famous dynamic programming question, and it worths looking into the detail. In this article, I will start with the leetcode question [416. Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/description/), and conclude multiple occasions of this kind of question.

### Leetcode 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum
#### Question
Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
Note:
* Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
* The array size will not exceed 200.

```
Example 1:
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```

#### Solution:
* Method 1: 2-D DP question
    1. This question requires us to think the question in a opposite way. If the array can be splited into 2 equal sum subset(for each one of the subsets, the sum is total_sum / 2).
    2. Now this question is changed into a another question: can we find a subset in the array, whose sum is expected sum?
        * for each number in the subset, we can assume it is the last number to be added to the subset, we have nums[i] + previous sum = half of the sum.
        * the question is then transfered to if we need to pick current value into the subset? So it is a 01 knapsack question.
    3. we create a 2-D boolean matrix called dp: dp[nums.length + 1][expect sum value + 1]. First index means we have up to i values from array,  second index means the expected value and value means: is it position to get j with previous i numbers from the array?
        * initialization:
            * dp[0][0] = true // we want 0 and we have nothing, possible.
            * dp[i][nums[i -1]] = true // we have that value and we want that value.
        * state transfer funtion
            * dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]
                * dp[i - 1][j]: we don't even need current value, previous subset has already create the expected sum.
                * dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]: we use current value nums[i - 1] as the last value add to the subset, if prevous sum can be j - nums[i - 1], we can get the expected sum.
        * return: dp[nums.length][expect]
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
            int sum = 0;
            for(int n : nums) sum += n;
            if((sum & 1) != 0) return false;
            int expect = sum >> 1;
            boolean[][] dp = new boolean[nums.length + 1][expect + 1];
            for(int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++){
                if(nums[i - 1] > expect) return false;
                dp[i][nums[i - 1]] = true;
                dp[i][0] = true;
            }
            dp[0][0] = true;   
            for(int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++){
                for(int j = 1; j <= expect; j++){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                    if(nums[i - 1] <= j)
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] || dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]);
                }
            }
            return dp[nums.length][expect];
        }
    }
    ```

* Method 2: 1-D dp
    * we create a 1-D boolean array dp[expect + 1] for keeping the result when we only have previous i numbers in the original array.
    * we need to traversal all numbers in the array. If dp[i] == true, it means dp[i + n] = true.
    * Once we find dp[half_sum] == true, we can return true;
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
            int sum = 0;
            for(int n : nums) sum += n;
            if((sum & 1) == 1) return false;
            boolean[] dp = new boolean[sum + 1];
            dp[0] = true;
            for(int n : nums){
                for(int i = sum; i >= 0; i--){
                    if(dp[i]) dp[i + n] = true;
                }
                if(dp[sum >> 1]) return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```

### Classic 01Knapsack question
#### Question:
We want to get max value with given weight., W = 4
| - | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| --- | --- | -- | -- | -- |
| w | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| v | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 |

#### transfer table
| - | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 0 | 0 | - | - | - | - |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | - | - | - |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | 3 | - | - |
| 3 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 7 |
| 4 | 0 | 2 | 5 | 7 | 9 |

#### Solution:
* Method 1: 2-D dp
    1. We need to create a 2-D array dp[i][j], i means we take the previous i items and j is the maximum weight at current stage and the value stored in the matrix represents the max value.
    2. For each station dp[i][j]:
        * current item can not be stored in the bag
            * dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        * current value can be stored in the bag
            * dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - weight[i - 1]] + value[i - 1])
            * Here means we are comparing not put the item into the bag and put the item into the bag condition.
    ```Java
    public static int maxValue(int[] value, int[] weight, int w){
        int len = value.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[len + 1][w + 1];
        int max = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= len; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= w; j++){
                if(weight[i - 1] > j){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j - weight[i - 1]] + value[i - 1], dp[i - 1][j]);
                }
                max = Math.max(max, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
    ```

* Method 2: We only use a 1-D array to store the maximum value.
    ```Java
    public static int maxValue1(int[] value, int[] weight, int w){
        int len = value.length;
        int[] dp = new int[w + 1];
        int max = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= len; i++){
            for(int j = w; j >= 1; j--){
                if(weight[i - 1] <= j){
                    dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - weight[i - 1]] + value[i - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[w];
    }
    ```
