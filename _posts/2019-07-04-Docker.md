### Introduction
Docker is a lite-weight container in operating systems. Different from VM(virtual machine), docker is good at its weight and usage. In this article, I will conclude how I install a docker in Linux Ubuntu platform.

Docker will share kernal with dominate operating system, it doesn't requires hypervisor(my understanding is adapter) between operation system and docker container.

#### Docker Image
Docker image is a special file system. It will provide the environment for running a docker container, including application, library, resource and configurations. Docker is like a class, it defines the structure and its related parameters. 

#### Docker Container
Docker container is an instance created with the definition of docker image.

#### Docker Repository
Docker Repository is a platform to save docker images. Its function is really like github.

### Docker Installation
1. Install docker application.
    ```Bash
    sudo apt install docker.io
    ```
    
2. Check docker installation
    ```Bash
    sudo docker info

3. Add current user to docker group
    ```Bash

    sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker # Add current user to docker group. 
    ```

4. Run/Stop docker
    * Docker application will run as a deamon thread.

3. Search docker images
    ```Bash
    docker search (image keyword)
    ```
    
4. Run one image
    ```Bash
    # Check the name of that image
    docker ps -a
    # Create a container for a image.
    docker run -itd -p 5000:5000 (image id)
    # Enter the container
    docker attach 199c8075258c
    ```

5. Exit the container
