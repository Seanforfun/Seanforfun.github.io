### Question
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

```
Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```

Note: Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int. 

### Solution
* Method 1: dp
    * dp[i]: up to current index, the max number of increasing subset.
    * count[i]: the number of ways to keep the maximum dp number up to index i.
        * update the maximum: we update the count to the previous ones, since we only need to append current value to all previous ones.
        * if max is the same, we need to append current value to  all previous ways.
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public int findNumberOfLIS(int[] nums) {
            int len = nums.length;
            if(len == 0) return 0;
            int[] dp = new int[len];
            int[] count = new int[len];
            Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
            Arrays.fill(count, 1);
            int max = 1;
            for(int i = 1; i < len; i++){
                for(int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--){
                    if(nums[i] > nums[j] && dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]){
                        dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
                        count[i] = count[j];
                    }else if(nums[i] > nums[j] && dp[j] + 1 == dp[i]){
                        count[i] += count[j];
                    }
                }
                max = Math.max(max, dp[i]);
            }
            int res = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
                if(dp[i] == max){
                    res += count[i];
                }
            }
            return res;
        }
    }
    ```
