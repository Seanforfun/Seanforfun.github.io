## 815. Bus Routes

### Question
We have a list of bus routes. Each routes[i] is a bus route that the i-th bus repeats forever. For example if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the first bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->... forever.

We start at bus stop S (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus stop T. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.

```
Example:
Input:
routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
S = 1
T = 6
Output: 2
Explanation:
The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
```

Note:
1. 1 <= routes.length <= 500.
2. 1 <= routes[i].length <= 500.
3. 0 <= routes[i][j] < 10 ^ 6.

### Solution
* Method 1: bfs
  * we need to construct a graph using map, where key is the stop number and value is a list recording all buses passes through this stop.
  * we also need a boolean array to record which bus is visited since all stops on this routes can be visited.
  ```Java
  class Solution {
      public int numBusesToDestination(int[][] routes, int S, int T) {
          if(S == T) return 0;
          // Create the graph
          Map<Integer, List<Integer>> g = new HashMap<>();
          for(int i = 0; i < routes.length; i++){
              for(int j = 0; j < routes[i].length; j++){
                  List<Integer> buses = g.containsKey(routes[i][j]) ? g.get(routes[i][j]): new ArrayList<>();
                  buses.add(i);
                  g.put(routes[i][j], buses);
              }
          }
          Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
          q.offer(S);
          int step = 0;
          boolean[] ride = new boolean[routes.length];
          while(!q.isEmpty()){
              int size = q.size();
              ++step;
              for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
                  int cur = q.poll();
                  // for each bus stop, get all buses that can pass through this stop
                  List<Integer> buses = g.get(cur);
                  for(Integer bus : buses){
                      if(ride[bus]) continue;
                      ride[bus] = true;
                      // If never visited this bus before, add all stops of this bus to the queue.
                      for(Integer stop : routes[bus]){
                          if(stop == T) return step;
                          q.offer(stop);
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
          return -1;
      }
  }
  ```
