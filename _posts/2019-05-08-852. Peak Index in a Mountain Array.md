## 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array

### Question:
Let's call an array A a mountain if the following properties hold:
* A.length >= 3
* There exists some 0 < i < A.length - 1 such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]

Given an array that is definitely a mountain, return any i such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1].

```
Example 1:

Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
```

Note:
1. 3 <= A.length <= 10000
2. 0 <= A[i] <= 10^6
3. A is a mountain, as defined above.


### Solution:
* Method 1: Binary search
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] A) {
            int low = 0, high = A.length - 1;
            while(low < high){
                int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
                if(A[mid] < A[mid + 1]) low = mid + 1;
                else high = mid;
            }
            return low;
        }
    }
    ```
