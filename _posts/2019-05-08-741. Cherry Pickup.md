## 741. Cherry Pickup

### Question
In a N x N grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.
* 0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;
* 1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;
* -1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

 

Your task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:
* Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (N-1, N-1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);
* After reaching (N-1, N-1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells;
* When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell becomes an empty cell (0);
* If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (N-1, N-1), then no cherries can be collected.

```
Example 1:

Input: grid =
[[0, 1, -1],
 [1, 0, -1],
 [1, 1,  1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
```

Note:
1. grid is an N by N 2D array, with 1 <= N <= 50.
2. Each grid[i][j] is an integer in the set {-1, 0, 1}.
3. It is guaranteed that grid[0][0] and grid[N-1][N-1] are not -1.

### Solution:
* Method 1: dp
    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Qm9Ymed.png)
    * dp[x1][y1][x2]: the max cherry can pick up to (x1, y1), (x2, y2) where y2 = x1 + y1 - x2. This dp means we have 2 people picking cherry from (0, 0) to (N - 1, N - 1).
    * dp[x1][y1][x2] = max(dp(x1 - 1, y1, x2), dp(x1, y1 - 1, x2), dp(x1 - 1, y1, x2 - 1), dp(x1, y1 - 1, x2 - 1)) + grid[x1][y1] + grid[x2][y2].
    * if both at same position, and current value is 1, only increase once.
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        private int[][][] dp;
        public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {
            int height = grid.length, width = grid[0].length;
            dp = new int[height][width][height];
            for(int i = 0; i < height; i++)
                for(int j = 0; j < width; j++)
                    Arrays.fill(dp[i][j], Integer.MIN_VALUE);
            return Math.max(dp(grid, height - 1, width - 1, height - 1), 0);
        }
        private int dp(int[][] grid, int x1, int y1, int x2){
            int y2 = x1 + y1 - x2;
            if(x1 < 0 || y1 < 0 || x2 < 0 || y2 < 0){
                return -1;
            }
            if(x1 == 0 && y1 == 0 && x2 == 0){
                dp[0][0][0] = grid[0][0];
                return dp[0][0][0];
            }
            if(dp[x1][y1][x2] != Integer.MIN_VALUE) return dp[x1][y1][x2];
            if(grid[x1][y1] == -1 || grid[x2][y2] == -1) return -1;
            dp[x1][y1][x2] = Math.max(Math.max(dp(grid, x1 - 1, y1, x2), dp(grid, x1, y1 - 1, x2)), 
                                       Math.max(dp(grid, x1, y1 - 1, x2 - 1), dp(grid, x1 - 1, y1, x2 - 1)));
            if(dp[x1][y1][x2] >= 0){
                int g1 = grid[x1][y1], g2 = grid[x2][y2];
                if(g1 >= 0) dp[x1][y1][x2] += g1;
                if(g2 >= 0) dp[x1][y1][x2] += g2;
                if(g1 == g2 && g1 == 1 && x1 == x2 && y1 == y2)
                    dp[x1][y1][x2]--;
            }
            return dp[x1][y1][x2];
        }
    }
    ```
