Hi, I am Botao Xiao, or you can call me Sean.

Currently, I am still a Master student from McMaster University ECE department(though I am already tired of staying at school LOL). I am a big fan of Java Web programming so I create this website for recording most of my conclusions in case I need them one day. They used to be recorded in my [Github](https://github.com/Seanforfun) account, if you like my conclusions, you can either star this [project](https://github.com/Seanforfun/Seanforfun.github.io) or follow me on Github.

Meanwhile, I am also responsible for some deep learning coding using Tensorflow. Maybe one day I will post some demonstrations related to this field. For now, you can go to my [Deep-Learning project](https://github.com/Seanforfun/Deep-Learning) for a glance.

Thank you for reading! And enjoy!
