<h3>Working Experience</h3>
<h4>Amazon (Dec, 2021 - Present)</h4>
  <li style="font-size:14px;">Software Development Engineer II (Dec, 2021 - Present)</li>
<p style="font-size:14px;">I will start my new journey at Amazon, working as Software Development Engineer II starting from Dec, 2021.</p>

<h4>Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd. (Sept, 2019 - Nov, 2021)</h4>
  <li style="font-size:14px;">Level 16. Software Engineer (Feb, 2021 - Nov, 2021)</li>
  <li style="font-size:14px;">Level 15. Associate Software Engineer (Sept, 2019 - Jan, 2021)</li>
<p style="font-size:14px;">After graduation from McMaster University(Sept, 2019), I participated Huawei Toronto Heterogeneous Compiler Lab and worked in the GPU compiler team. During my working period at Huawei, I delivered varies topics for compiler optimizations and single-handedly reduced 5% - 10% of our GPU bundle count on different benchmarks, and significantly reduce the power consumption by implementing key features. Not only working as a software developer, I also participated the Hardware-Software co-design for our GPU's future versions on multiple GPU specific features.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">Since Feb 2021, I started managing Canada team's code quality status. For that role, I needed to assign the bug tickets to the right person based on my deep understanding to the GPU architecture and helped with solving emergent version release blocking problems.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">Besides delivering code for our project, I also spent a lot of time on researching. I gave technical talks to the whole team(Canada team and China team) periodically on multiple up-to-date topics based on my research from papers and patents. I co-issued a patent(“Method and system for algebraic expression code motion in rasterization pipeline”) with my supervisor.</p>

<h4>McMaster University (Sept, 2021 - April, 2019)</h4>
  <li style="font-size:14px;">Teaching Assistance pt. (Sept, 2018 - April, 2019)</li>
<p style="font-size:14px;">I was the Teaching Assistance for courses 4DM4 Computer Architecture and 2DP4 Microprocessor Systems in two different semesters. During my TA period, I was responsible for managing the experiment sessions, marking exams and answering students' questions. I not only attended all required sessions but also participated all the lectures which are not mandatory for TAs. I kept receiving Thank you messages from my students through LinkedIn after my graduation.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">I joined ELEX in the one year gap between my undergraduate and my master degree. I worked at the MISDMS(Mobile information sensitive data monitoring system) project. I used Intel's open source project DPDK to create a high volume data transferring platform, and within that 10 months, we created a single server data transferring platform with average 50G/s bandwidth from nothing.</p>
