<p>Hi, I am Botao Xiao, or you can call me Sean.</p>

<p>I am a MASc student in McMaster University ECE department and will graduate in Aug, 2019. Before starting my Master degree, I had been worked as a software development engineer.</p>

<p>I am interested in Java Web programming and spent last two years on most of the famous back-end techniques, and in the last period of my master degree, I will focus myself on cloud computing. You can find the following knowledge in my blog:</p>
<dl><a href="https://seanforfun.github.io/posts/">Backend techniques</a></dl>
<dl><a href="https://seanforfun.github.io/posts/">Data Structure</a></dl>
<dl><a href="https://seanforfun.github.io/leetcode/">Algorithm(Based on Leetcode)</a></dl>

<p>Some of those conclusions used to be recorded in my <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun">Github account</a>. If you like my conclusions, you can either star this <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun/Seanforfun.github.io">project</a> or follow me on Github.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I am also responsible for some deep learning coding using Tensorflow. You can go to the <a href="https://seanforfun.github.io/DeepLearning/">Deep Learning</a> link for more information. I finished 2 projects in 2018, which are Haze removal and Car oriented image matting. The code for <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun/Deep-Learning/tree/master/DehazeNet">Haze Removal</a> is open sourced and can be used on non-commercial purpose. The car oriented image matting project belongs to company Car media 2.0 now and cannot be open sourced, however, discussions are welcomed.

<p>Thank you for reading! And enjoy!</p>
