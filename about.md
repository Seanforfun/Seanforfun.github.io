<p>Hi, I am Botao Xiao, or you can call me Sean.</p>

<p>Currently, I am still a Master student from McMaster University ECE department(though I am already tired of staying at school LOL). I am a big fan of Java Web programming so I create this website for recording most of my conclusions in case I need them one day. They used to be recorded in my <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun">Github account</a>, if you like my conclusions, you can either star this <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun/Seanforfun.github.io">project</a> or follow me on Github.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I am also responsible for some deep learning coding using Tensorflow. Maybe one day I will post some demonstrations related to this field. For now, you can go to my <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun/Deep-Learning">Deep-Learning project</a> for a glance.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! And enjoy!</p>
