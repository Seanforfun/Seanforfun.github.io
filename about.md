<h3>Working Experience</h3>
<h4>Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd. (Sept, 2019 - Nov, 2021)</h4>
  <li style="font-size:14px;">Level 16. Software Engineer (Feb, 2021 - Nov, 2021)</li>
  <li style="font-size:14px;">Level 15. Associate Software Engineer (Sept, 2019 - Jan, 2021)</li>
<p style="font-size:14px;">After graduation from McMaster University(Sept, 2019), I participated Huawei Toronto Heterogeneous Compiler Lab and worked in the GPU compiler team. During my working period at Huawei, I delivered varies topics of compiler optimizations(over 120 patches) and single-handedly reduced 5% - 10% of our GPU bundle count on different benchmarks. I also participated the Hardware-Software co-design process for future GPU versions on multiple GPU specific features. Since Feb 2021, I started managing Canada team's bug fixing status, in that role, I needed to assign the bug tickets to the right person based on my complete understanding to the GPU architecture. Besides delivering code for our project, I also spent a lot of time on researching. I gave technical talks to the whole team(Canada team and China team) periodically on multiple up-to-date topics based on my research and co-issued a patent(“Method and system for algebraic expression code motion in rasterization pipeline”) with my supervisor.</p>
