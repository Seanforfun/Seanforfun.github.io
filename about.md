<p>Hi, I am Botao Xiao, or you can call me Sean.</p>

<p>I am a MASc student in McMaster University ECE department and will graduate in Aug, 2019. Before starting my Master degree, I had been worked as a software development engineer.</p>

<p>I am interested in Java Web programming and spent last two years on most of the famous back-end techniques, and in the last period of my master degree, I will focus myself on backed skills and cloud. You can run into the following knowledge within my tech-blog:</p>
<dl><a href="https://seanforfun.github.io/posts/">Backend techniques</a></dl>
<dl><a href="https://seanforfun.github.io/posts/">Data Structure</a></dl>
<dl><a href="https://seanforfun.github.io/leetcode/">Algorithm(Based on Leetcode)</a></dl>

<p>Some of those conclusions used to be recorded in my <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun">Github account</a>. If you like my conclusions, you can either star this <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun/Seanforfun.github.io">project</a> or follow me on Github.</p>

<p>I am also the TA of two undergrad courses in Mcmaster ECE department, which are:</p>
<dl><a href="http://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/faculty/teds/COURSES/4DM4-default.html">4DM4 Computer architecture</a></dl>
<dl><a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/sites/default/files/compeng_2dp4_c01c02_w2019.pdf">2DP4 Microprocessor Systems</a></dl>

<p>Meanwhile, I am also responsible for some deep learning coding using Tensorflow. You can go to the <a href="https://seanforfun.github.io/DeepLearning/">Deep Learning</a> link for more information. I finished 2 projects in 2018, which are Haze removal and Car oriented image matting. The code for <a href="https://github.com/Seanforfun/GMAN_Net_Haze_Removal">Haze Removal</a> is open sourced and can be used on non-commercial purpose. The car oriented image matting project belongs to company Car media 2.0 now and cannot be open sourced, however, discussions are welcomed.

<p>Since my graduate date is approaching, I'm thinking about having a full-time SDE in Waterloo, Toronto and Ottawa region. Please you have any empty role related to Java backend, please send me an e-mail!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! And enjoy!</p>
