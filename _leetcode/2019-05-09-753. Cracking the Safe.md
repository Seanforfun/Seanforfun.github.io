## 753. Cracking the Safe

### Question
 There is a box protected by a password. The password is n digits, where each letter can be one of the first k digits 0, 1, ..., k-1.

You can keep inputting the password, the password will automatically be matched against the last n digits entered.

For example, assuming the password is "345", I can open it when I type "012345", but I enter a total of 6 digits.

Please return any string of minimum length that is guaranteed to open the box after the entire string is inputted.

```
Example 1:

Input: n = 1, k = 2
Output: "01"
Note: "10" will be accepted too.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "00110"
Note: "01100", "10011", "11001" will be accepted too.
```

Note:
1. n will be in the range [1, 4].
2. k will be in the range [1, 10].
3. k^n will be at most 4096.


### Solutions
* Method 1: DFS: Hamiltonion path.
    * Hamilton path question is visiting all of the states without repeating.
    * What's the path between the states in this question?
        * For each state, its length is n, and next node can re-use previous node's last n - 1 characters.
        * for example, we have 0 and 1 to use.
        * first node is 00, second reuses 0 and append 0 or 1.
    * Analyse this question
        * If we cannot re-use previous node, we have total length of (k ^ n) * n
        * Since we can re-use previous node's n - 1 character, we have the total length of k ^ n + n - 1
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        private int expect; // total length of result.
        private int k;
        private int n;
        public String crackSafe(int n, int k) {
            this.expect = (int)Math.pow((double)k, (double)n) + n - 1;
            this.k = k;
            this.n = n;
            StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) res.append(0);
            Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
            visited.add(res.toString());
            dfs(res, visited);
            return res.toString();
        }
        private boolean dfs(StringBuilder sb, Set<String> visited){
            if(sb.length() == expect) return true;
            // sb currently saves the string and we will reuse last n - 1 characters.
            String pre = sb.substring(sb.length() - n + 1);
            for(char c = '0'; c < '0' + k; c++){
                String current = pre + c;
                if(visited.contains(current)) continue;
                visited.add(current);
                sb.append(c);
                if(dfs(sb, visited)) return true;
                sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
                visited.remove(current);
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
