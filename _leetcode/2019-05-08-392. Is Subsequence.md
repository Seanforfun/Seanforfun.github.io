### Question
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

```
Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.
```

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

### Solutions
* Method 1: 2 pointers
	```Java
	class Solution {
		public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
			int sLen = s.length(), tLen = t.length();
			if(sLen > tLen) return false;
			else if(sLen == 0) return true;
			int index1 = 0, index2 = 0;
			while(index1 < sLen && index2 < tLen){
				if(s.charAt(index1) == t.charAt(index2)){
					index1++;
					index2++;
				}else{
					index2++;
				}
			}
			return index1 == sLen;
		}
	}
	```

* Method 2: dp
	```Java
	class Solution {
		public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
			int sLen = s.length(), tLen = t.length();
			boolean[][] dp = new boolean[tLen + 1][sLen + 1];
			for(int i = 0; i <= tLen; i++){
				dp[i][0] = true;
			}
			for(int i = 1; i <= tLen; i++){
				for(int j = 1; j <= sLen; j++){
					if(s.charAt(j - 1) == t.charAt(i - 1)){
						dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
					}else{
						dp[i][j] |= dp[i - 1][j];
					}
				}
			}
			return dp[tLen][sLen];
		}
	}
