## 937. Reorder Log Files

### Question
You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

1. Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
2. Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.

We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

```
Example 1:

Input: ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]
```

Note:
* 0 <= logs.length <= 100
* 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
* logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

### Thinking:
* Method 1: Comparator + Sort
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
            int len = logs.length;
            if(len == 0) return logs;
            String[] result = new String[len];
            List<String> numList = new ArrayList<>();
            List<String> cList = new ArrayList<>();
            for(String log : logs){
                if(isNumber(log))   numList.add(log);
                else cList.add(log);
            }
            Collections.sort(cList, new Comparator<String>(){
                @Override
                 public int compare(String a, String b){
                    int index1 = a.indexOf(" ");
                    int index2 = b.indexOf(" ");
                    int cmp = a.substring(index1 + 1).compareTo(b.substring(index2 + 1));
                    if(cmp != 0) return cmp;
                    return a.substring(0, index1).compareTo(b.substring(0, index2));
                }
            });
            int count = 0;
            for(String s: cList){
                result[count++] = s;
            }
            for(String s : numList){
                result[count++] = s;
            }
            return result;
        }
        private boolean isNumber(String s){
            int index = s.indexOf(" ");
            return Character.isDigit(s.charAt(index + 1));
        }
    }
    ```
