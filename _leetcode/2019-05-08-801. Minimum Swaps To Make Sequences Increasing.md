## 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing

### Question
We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

```
Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
```

Note:
* A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range [1, 1000].
* A[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].

### Solution
* Method 1: dp
    * we need to maintain 2 states: keep[i] and swap[i]. i means up to index i, two arrays are strictly increasing.
        * keep[i] means index i is not swapped.
        * swap[i] means index i is swapped.
    * Emample:
        * A: [x, x, x, 1 , 4]
        * B: [x, x, x, 2 , 3]
    * Two conditions:
        1. A[i - 1] < A[i] && B[i - 1] < B[i] Up to current index, two arrays have already met the requirement.
            * keep[i] = keep[i - 1]  Nothing changed
            * swap[i] = swap[i - 1] + 1 both changed
                * A: [x, x, x, 2, 3]
                * B: [x, x, x, 1, 4]
        2. A[i - 1] < B[i] && B[i - 1] < A[i]
            * keep[i] = min(keep[i], swap[i - 1])   current i is not swapped, previous one swapped
                * A: [x, x, x, 2, 4]
                * B: [x, x, x, 1, 3]
            * swap[i] = min(swap[i], keep[i - 1] + 1)   current is swapped, swap previous pair
                * A: [x, x, x, 2, 4]
                * B: [x, x, x, 1, 3]
    * Initialization
        * keep[0] = 0
        * swap[0] = 1
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public int minSwap(int[] A, int[] B) {
            int len = A.length;
            if(len <= 1) return 0;
            int[] keep = new int[len];
            int[] swap = new int[len];
            Arrays.fill(keep, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            Arrays.fill(swap, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            keep[0] = 0; swap[0] = 0;
            for(int i = 1; i < len; i++){
                if(A[i - 1] < A[i] && B[i - 1] < B[i]){
                    keep[i] = keep[i - 1];
                    swap[i] = swap[i - 1] + 1;
                }
                if(A[i] > B[i - 1] && B[i] > A[i - 1]){
                    keep[i] = Math.min(keep[i], swap[i - 1]);
                    swap[i] = Math.min(swap[i], keep[i - 1] + 1);
                }
            }
            return Math.min(keep[len - 1], swap[len - 1]);
        }
    }
    ```
