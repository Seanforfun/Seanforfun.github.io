## 668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table

### Question
Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you find out the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?

Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table, and a positive integer k, you need to return the k-th smallest number in this table.

```
Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output:
Explanation:
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6
3	6	9

The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
Example 2:
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output:
Explanation:
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6

The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
```

Note:
1. The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
2. The k will be in the range [1, m * n]

### Solution
* Method 1: binary search
  ```Java
  class Solution {
      public int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
         int low = 1, high = m * n;
          while(low <= high){
              int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
              int count = getLowerNum(m, n, mid);
              if(count < k) low = mid + 1;
              else high = mid - 1;
          }
          return low;
      }
      private int getLowerNum(int m, int n, int target){
          int row = m - 1, col = 0;
          int res = 0;
          while(row >= 0 && col < n){
              if((row + 1) * (col + 1) > target) row--;
              else{
                  res += row + 1;
                  col++;
              }
          }
          return res;
      }
  }
  ```
