## 788. Rotated Digits

### Question
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?

```
Example:
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
```

Note:
1. N  will be in range [1, 10000].

### Solution
* Method 1: HashMap / Array
  ```Java
  class Solution {
      private int[] arr;
      public int rotatedDigits(int N) {
          this.arr = new int[10];
          Arrays.fill(arr, -1);
          arr[0] = 0;
          arr[1] = 1;
          arr[8] = 8;
          arr[2] = 5;
          arr[5] = 2;
          arr[6] = 9;
          arr[9] = 6;
          int count = 0;
          for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
              if(isValid(i)) count++;
          }
          return count;
      }
      private boolean isValid(int N){
          int origin = N;
          int next = 0;
          int v = 1;
          while(N > 0){
              int cur = N % 10;
              if(arr[cur] == -1) return false;
              next = next + arr[cur] * v;
              N /= 10;
              v *= 10;
          }
          return origin != next;
      }
  }
  ```
