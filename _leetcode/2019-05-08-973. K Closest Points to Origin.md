## 973. K Closest Points to Origin

### Question
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

```
Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

Note:
1. 1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
2. -10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
3. -10000 < points[i][1] < 10000

### Solutions:
* Method 1: PriorityQueue
  ```Java
  class Solution {
      public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
          PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<int[]>(){
              @Override
              public int compare(int[] a, int[] b){
                  return a[0] * a[0] + a[1] * a[1] - b[0] * b[0] - b[1] * b[1];
              }
          });
          for(int[] point : points)   pq.offer(point);
          int[][] res = new int[K][2];
          int count = 0;
          for(int i = 0; i < K; i++){
              res[i] = pq.poll();
          }
          return res;
      }
  }
  ```
