## 528. Random Pick with Weight

### Question
Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:
* 1 <= w.length <= 10000
* 1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
* pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.

```
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]

Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
```

Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.


### Solutions:
* Method 1:  O(n) for each pick
    ```
    class Solution {
        private static Random random = new Random();
        private int[] w;
        private int sum;
        public Solution(int[] w) {
            this.w = w;
            for(int num : w) this.sum += num;
        }
        
        public int pickIndex() {
            int rand = random.nextInt(sum) + 1;
            int temp = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < w.length; i++){
                if(temp + w[i] >= rand) return i;
                temp += w[i];
            }
            return w.length - 1;
        }
    }
    
    /**
     * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
     * Solution obj = new Solution(w);
     * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
     */
    ```

* Method 2: Binary search O(lgN)
    * we take the sum up to all indexes.
    * we use binary search to find the first number bigger(or equal to) the random value.
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        private static Random random = new Random();
        private int[] w;
        public Solution(int[] w) {
            this.w = w;
            for(int i = 1; i < w.length; i++){
                w[i] += w[i - 1];
            }
        }
        
        public int pickIndex() {
            int rand = random.nextInt(w[w.length - 1]) + 1;
            int left = 0, right = w.length - 1;
            while(left < right){
                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                if(w[mid] == rand) return mid;
                else if(w[mid] < rand) left = mid + 1;
                else right = mid;
            }
            return left;
        }
    }
    
    /**
     * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
     * Solution obj = new Solution(w);
     * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
     */
    ```
